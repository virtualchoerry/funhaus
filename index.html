<p> hello my name is michael this is my website i developed in class for html! <br> i don't really plan on doing anything useful with this because I have no ideas but for now it's where I test my code and learn more on how to use CSS. <br> for example, in my "Fun" page, I tested how to add audio, how to hyperlink images to gifs, how to link them to youtube videos, and other style tags. </p>
